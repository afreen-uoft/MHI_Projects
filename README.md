# Afreen Rehman - MHI Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my Master of Health Informatics (MHI) portfolio repository. This collection includes academic submissions, case studies, reflection papers, and presentations completed throughout the MHI program at the University of Toronto.

Each project is grounded in real-world healthcare challenges, digital transformation strategies, and health system analysis. The repository serves as a demonstration of my skills in critical thinking, system evaluation, policy analysis, and technology implementation in the healthcare domain.
